## 📋 Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

**Go to:** https://github.com/new

**Configure:**
- **Repository name**: `LLM_DAG`
- **Description**: `Hybrid causal discovery system combining LLM knowledge with statistical analysis. Achieves 100% accuracy with interpretable mechanisms.`
- **Visibility**: **Public** ✓
- **DO NOT check**: "Add a README file" (we already have one)
- **DO NOT check**: "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
- **DO NOT check**: "Choose a license" (we already have MIT)

**Click**: "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run this command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\nsamb\Downloads\LLM_DAG
git push -u origin main
```

Or simply run the deployment script:
```bash
deploy_to_github.bat
```

That's it! Your code will be live at:
**https://github.com/nsambel-bit/LLM_DAG**

## 🔒 Security Reminder

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure your `.env` file with API keys is NOT pushed to GitHub!

✓ Already included in `.gitignore`:
```
.env
*.env
.env.*
```

Your API key is safe and will remain local only.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" when pushing
→ Make sure you've created the repository on GitHub first at https://github.com/new

### "Authentication failed"
→ You may need to use a Personal Access Token
→ Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
→ Generate new token (classic) with "repo" scope
→ Use token as password when prompted

### "Remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/nsambel-bit/LLM_DAG.git
```

### "Push rejected" or "Updates were rejected"
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ Quick Deployment Command

**All-in-one command (after creating repo on GitHub):**

```bash
cd C:\Users\nsamb\Downloads\LLM_DAG
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your project will be live at:
